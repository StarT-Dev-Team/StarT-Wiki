# Challenges 
Besides the default gamemode, Star Technology can be played in 2 different "challenge" modes, namely, Abyodos mode and Hard mode. It should be noted that these 2 gamemodes are not at the same place in terms of development.

## Hard Mode
A much harder rendition of the main game. Highly reccomended that you attempt this mode after completing the main mode.

## Abydos Start
Why work towards the Clasic Stargate to reach Abydos when you can just start there? Start your journery in abydos, a vast dessert, and try to make your way back home.
