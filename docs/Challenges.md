# Challenges 
Besides the default gamemode, Star Technology can be played in 2 different "challenge" modes, namely, Abyodos mode and Hard mode. It should be noted that these 2 gamemodes are not at the same place in terms of development.

## Hard Mode
A much harder rendition of the main game. Highly reccomended that you attempt this mode after completing the main mode. If you thought that this wiki would guide you through it, think again. **0 DOCUMENTATION**, your all on your own

## Abydos Start
Why work towards the Clasic Stargate to reach Abydos when you can just start there? Start your journery in abydos, a vast dessert, and try to make your way back home. There are only minor differences in this mode. Most of the progression is the same as normal.
