# Nitrogen

## How to obtain Nitrogen

**1. Air centrifuging**

***You can obtain [Oxygen](/StarT-Wiki/Gameplay/Lines/Chemical Lines/Gases/Oxygen) and Nitrogen from centrifuging air.***

**2. Ender Pearl electrolysis**

***You can obtain Nitrogen aswell as some Beryllium and Potassium Dust as byproducts from macerating Ender Pearls into Ender Pearl Dust and electrolyzing it.***

**3. Saltpeter Dust electrolysis**

***You can obtain [Oxygen](/StarT-Wiki/Gameplay/Lines/Chemical Lines/Gases/Oxygen) and Nitrogen aswell as Potassium Dust as a byproduct from electrolyzing Saltpeter Dust.***

**4. Liquid Air Distillation**

***From HV onwards with the introduction of the Distillation Tower u can get Nitrogen aswell as some other useful gases such as [Oxygen](/StarT-Wiki/Gameplay/Lines/Chemical Lines/Gases/Oxygen), Carbon Dioxide, Helium and Argon.***

**5. Exotig Gas Siphoning**

***After reaching Abydos through the completion of the Star Gate u get access to new Ores, from which some of them are used to make the Exotic Gas Siphon, the main Endgame Nitrogen source, completely replacing Liquid Air Distillation.***
