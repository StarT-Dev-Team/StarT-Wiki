# What are Stress Units

## The basics

Stress units \(from here on reffered as **SU**\) are the power that all create machines use.

There are many ways to generate **SU** but in the earlygame your bes solution it spamming Large Water Wheels everywhere. a single large waterwheel generates 512**su** provided that it has water or lava flowing on one of its sides.

**SU** is consumed by most create machines. Their **SU** consumption equals their stress impact\(exact value can be seen only with **create goggles**\) multiplied by their [**RPM**](/docs/Gameplay/Mechanics/Create/RPM.md)

Machines consume **SU** at a constant rate and consume it even if they are not doing anything at the moment. 


## Alternative SU generation options

**SU** can be generated in many ways, alternatives include windmills, and steam engines.

### Windmill

They require a **windmill bearing** to operate. Additionaly it needs at least **8** sail like blocks to start, theese can be, windmill sails, sail frames, or wool. 

It also will rotate any structure that is glued onto it, the face that spins glues to the block opposite to it so you can add attidional blocks, the more sails you have the faster it will spin. 

You will reach maximum **SU** generation by adding 128 sails, in total that will generate 8192**su**

### Steam Engine

Steam engines are the best source of **SU** generation in create being moderatly difficult to setup but providing a lot of **SU** in return. They are a multiblock structure consisting of **Copper Tanks** in a 1x1 2x2 or 3x3 arrangment, and **Steam Engine** blocks connected to it\(you need to place a shaft on the engine block to get output\).

For it to function you need to supply **heat** from below and **water** from any side. Heat can be provided by **basic burners** as blaze burners are not accesible until way later in the game. You need to provide the basic burners with charcoal and ignite them with a flint and steel.

Steam Engines work on a level system which can be increased by making the tank bigger, providing more heat, and providing more water. by using 9 basic burners you can only get up to **level 9**. You can make them act like blaze burners my pointing a **256rpm fan** at their side but that will only get you to **level 17** as you cannot power the middle one. Though this is generaly not advised as it consumes roughly 20x the amount of fuel.

Per every level of the Steam Engine you need to add more steam engine blocks to achieve maximum output.
