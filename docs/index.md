# Welcome to Star Technology

## What is Star Technology?
Star Technology is one of the first **GregTech CEu Modern** modpacks for **Minecraft 1.19.2**, now fully updated to **1.20.1**! While still under development, the pack is fully playable **up to Maxwell** ***(mid UIV)***, with **Post-UHV content actively being worked on!**

This is **not** a beginner-friendly modpack, but we are constantly improving accessibility to make it more approachable for new players.

## Key Features

✨ **Deep & Extensive Progression** – Built on GregTech CEu Modern's foundation, with custom additions to spice up the gameplay and introduce progression beyond UHV!

🌌 **Unique Resource Gathering** – Start with Ex Nihilo, then advance into void miners, oil drilling rigs, and complex but rewarding processing lines.

🌀 **Dimensional Travel** – Explore the universe via stargates!

📖 **Comprehensive Quest Book** – Updated with every release to guide your journey.

🐱 **Komaru** – Your loyal feline companion, here to emotionally support you through the grind!

Inspired by legendary **GregTech** modpacks like *Nomifactory*, *Gregtech: New Horizons*, and *Technological Journey*, **Star Technology** brings their best ideas into a **skyblock setting**. Huge respect to their creators—check them out too!
