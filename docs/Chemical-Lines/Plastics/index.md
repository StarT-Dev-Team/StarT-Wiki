# Plastics

Plastics comprise a wide range of synthetic/semisynthetic materials composed primarily of polymers. Their most defining characteristic is their plasticity, that is, the ability to be molded, extruded, and pressed into a various amount of forms. Plastics are used to insulate cabling; the construction of busses, hatches, and casings; as well as in the assembly of numerous components later on.

As you progress up the voltage tiers, you unlock more and more complex and advanced plastics, used for things both new and old. You will often find that user higher tier plastics grant more yield, such as when covering cables.
