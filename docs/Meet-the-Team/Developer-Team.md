# Developer team

## trulyno - Project Owner

Hi! I'm truly and I'm a computer science student specializing in backend stuff. I'm proficient in Java, Python and JavaScript. I'm a Minecraft modding, programming and science enthusiast! Another passion of mine is music, my favorite artists being Muse, the Rare Occasions, Good Kid, Cage the Elephant and Arctic Monkeys!

## KillLaAqua - Lead Developer

Hii... I'm KillLaAqua. Currently I am a University Student studying Management Information Systems and Accounting (I'm an outlier womp womp). I often do balancing and play games in my free-time like a weirdo. Because of this, for StarT, I lead a lot of the balancing and the Endgame of the pack in addition to leading the Hard Mode development team. Besides hyper fixating and spreading democracy in the rest of my "free" time I enjoy EDM music and going on hikes/backpacking.

## stellaurora - Developer

Hi! I'm stellaurora and I'm a computer science student. I'm interested in systems & low level programming along with high level web development and graphics design. I'm a programming and open source enthusiast with a love for Linux. I enjoy reading novels in my spare time and listening to music from EDM to hip-hop.

## UltraPuPower1 - Developer

Hey there, I am UltraPuPower. I hope to study computer science at university soon. I like programming (what a surprise), reading and minecraft. I enjoy learning about anything related to science, and enjoy maths. If you have any questions, ask away in discord.

## Azu - Artist

Heya! I'm Azu aka GabiMar, I'm a computer science student, a modding enthusiast and an ***artist*** according to handful of folk. I dabble in many forms of art (with questionable success), from graphics design to 3d modeling, pixel art, music and more! My music taste is an abhorrent cacophony of genres and eras. Just hoping to make something people will enjoy <3
